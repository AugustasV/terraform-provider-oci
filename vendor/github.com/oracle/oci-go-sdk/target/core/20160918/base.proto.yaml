          [API Errors](/Content/API/References/apierrors.htm).
      message:
        type: string
        description: A human-readable error string.
    required:
    - code
    - message

parameters:
  AvailabilityDomainQueryParam:
    description: |
      The name of the Availability Domain.

      Example: `Uocm:PHX-AD-1`

    in: query
    name: availabilityDomain
    required: false
    type: string
  CompartmentIdQueryParam:
    description: The OCID of the compartment.
    in: query
    maxLength: 255
    minLength: 1
    name: compartmentId
    required: true
    type: string
  FilterByDisplayNameQueryParam:
    name: displayName
    in: query
    maxLength: 255
    minLength: 1
    required: false
    type: string
    description: |
      A filter to return only resources that match the given display name exactly.
  IfMatchHeader:
    description: |
      For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a resource, set the `if-match`
      parameter to the value of the etag from a previous GET or POST response for that resource.  The resource
      will be updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource's current etag value.
    in: header
    name: if-match
    type: string
  PaginationLimitQueryParam:
    description: |
      The maximum number of items to return in a paginated "List" call.

      Example: `500`

    in: query
    maximum: 1000
    minimum: 1
    name: limit
    type: integer
  PaginationTokenQueryParam:
    description: |
      The value of the `opc-next-page` response header from the previous "List" call.
    in: query
    maxLength: 512
    minLength: 1
    name: page
    type: string
  RetryTokenHeader:
    description: |
      A token that uniquely identifies a request so it can be retried in case of a timeout or
      server error without risk of executing that same action again. Retry tokens expire after 24
      hours, but can be invalidated before then due to conflicting operations (for example, if a resource
      has been deleted and purged from the system, then a retry of the original creation request
      may be rejected).
    in: header
    maxLength: 64
    minLength: 1
    name: opc-retry-token
    type: string
  SortByQueryParam:
    name: sortBy
    in: query
    required: false
    type: string
    enum:
    - TIMECREATED
    - DISPLAYNAME
    description: |
      The field to sort by. You can provide one sort order (`sortOrder`). Default order for
      TIMECREATED is descending. Default order for DISPLAYNAME is ascending. The DISPLAYNAME
      sort order is case sensitive.

      **Note:** In general, some "List" operations (for example, `ListInstances`) let you
      optionally filter by Availability Domain if the scope of the resource type is within a
      single Availability Domain. If you call one of these "List" operations without specifying
      an Availability Domain, the resources are grouped by Availability Domain, then sorted.
  SortOrderQueryParam:
      name: sortOrder
      in: query
      required: false
      type: string
      enum:
      - ASC
      - DESC
      description: |
        The sort order to use, either ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`). The DISPLAYNAME sort order
        is case sensitive.
  RequiredAvailabilityDomainQueryParam:
    description: |
      The name of the Availability Domain.

      Example: `Uocm:PHX-AD-1`

    description: |
      Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no
      predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see
