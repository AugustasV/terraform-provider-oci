# Data Source: oci_waas_custom_protection_rule
This data source provides details about a specific Custom Protection Rule resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Waas service.

Gets the details of a Custom Protection rule.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_waas_custom_protection_rule" "test_custom_protection_rule" {
	#Required
	custom_protection_rule_id = "${oci_waas_custom_protection_rule.test_custom_protection_rule.id}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `custom_protection_rule_id` - (Required) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the Custom Protection rule. This number is generated when the Custom Protection rule is added to the compartment.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `compartment_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the Custom Protection rule's compartment.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `description` - The description of the Custom Protection rule.
* `display_name` - The user-friendly name of the Custom Protection rule.
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the Custom Protection rule.
* `mod_security_rule_ids` - The list of the ModSecurity rule IDs that apply to this protection rule. For more information about ModSecurity's open source WAF rules, see [Mod Security's documentation](https://www.modsecurity.org/CRS/Documentation/index.html).
* `state` - The current lifecycle state of the Custom Protection rule.
* `template` - The template text of the Custom Protection rule. The syntax is based on ModSecurity Rule Language. Additionally it needs to include two variables / placeholders which will be replaced during publishing.
	* **{{mode}}** - rule action, defined by user in UI, like `OFF`, `DETECT` or `BLOCK`.
	* **{{id_1}}** - unique rule ID which identifies a `SecRule`, generated by the system. Multiple IDs can be used by increasing the number of the variable for every `SecRule` defined in the template.

	*Example usage:* ``` SecRule REQUEST_COOKIES "regex matching SQL injection - part 1/2" \ "phase:2,                                                 \ msg:'Detects chained SQL injection attempts 1/2.',        \ id: {{id_1}},                                             \ ctl:ruleEngine={{mode}},                                  \ deny" SecRule REQUEST_COOKIES "regex matching SQL injection - part 2/2" \ "phase:2,                                                 \ msg:'Detects chained SQL injection attempts 2/2.',        \ id: {{id_2}},                                             \ ctl:ruleEngine={{mode}},                                  \ deny" ``` The example contains two `SecRules` each having distinct regex expression to match `Cookie` header value during second input analysis phase. The disruptive `deny` action takes effect only when `{{mode}}` is set to `BLOCK`. The message is logged either when `{{mode}}` is set to `DETECT` or `BLOCK`.

* `time_created` - The date and time the protection rule was created, expressed in RFC 3339 timestamp format.
